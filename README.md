:mage: Howdy, Iâ€™m Billiam :rainbow_flag::transgender_flag:

I like Maths, coding, and Star Trek â€“ Qapla'!

I'm a Data person, specialising in SQL and Python. A lot of my brain power is spent thinking about automation, optimisation, application structure, and data modelling.

I'm motivated by "how I do" rather than "what I do".

Some of my pet peeves include:
- Homonyms
- The `OUTER` keyword
- Datetime formats that don't follow [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)


<!-- A little bit about me -->
:thinking: Who is Billiam anyway?
