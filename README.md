:mage: Howdy, I’m Bill Wallis
---
I like Maths, coding, and Star Trek – Qapla'!

In the professional world, I use Alteryx for analytics, Tableau for reporting, Python and VBA for automation, and SQL to drive all of the above with clean and efficient queries from the warehouse. I’m comfortable playing with APIs, different databases (SQL and NoSQL), and web scraping. I’m slowly working towards a more Python-oriented way of working, so that I can talk to databases, APIs, and myself all in one go.

I'm motivated by "how I do" rather than "what I do".

Some of my pet peeves include:
- Homonyms
- Ted Mosby
- Datetime formats that don't follow [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)
